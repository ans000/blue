    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        For the issue pointed out in the brief that young girls are dropping out of sports, by exploring the reasons behind this phenomenon and looking for possible solutions, we focused on athlete role models. After understanding the impact that role models can have on youth, we believe that identity more high-quality female role models can be a solution to the issue of young girls dropping out of sports.
        </br></br>As we discussed this topic further, we found that there is a lack of female role model in sports and this is an issue that worth more attention.From our project, we mainly discussed what and how is the influence of sports brands and mass media on role modeling process.
        </br></br>Our finding was clarified that is still a big gap in sport sector, when it comes to female athletes as endorsers and as role model.
        </br>Although many efforts to support women in sport field, and many campaigns supporting this idea, yet brands and mainstream media not paying more attention as should be to female athletes compared this to male athletes, yet the focus on male athletes and male as role model is more than on female athletes.
        </br></br>However, the good news is that some sports brands and media are starting to look at this issue and try to make a change.
        </br>Adidas launched the “Here to create change” campaign to help build up female role model in sports and to keep teen girls in sport after they leave school. BBC Sport launches its #changethegame women's summer of sport season to celebrate female athletes.
        </br></br>We can see the social attention on this issue, but still not enough. This is the issue that still need more effort to address.
