        <h2>Interview</h2>
        <p>Since the nature of the questionnaire is objective, its questions are all closed ended. In order to get more subjective responses on our topic, we used interview as one of our research methods at the same time.
        </br></br>Since the topic of female role models involves female athletes, the public(fans), sports brands and media. Therefore, we divided and identified the following respondent groups to gain different opinions from different perspectives: the public, young female athletes, and experts who have studied or are representative of this field.</p>

                <p>Since everyone's definition of role models is different, in order to have a deeper understanding of the public's ideas, in addition to the data questionnaire, we conducted a Vox Pop. Through interactive Vox Pop and open questions, we collected some intuitive understandings of role models and some understanding of female athlete role models.</p>

                <p>In order to understand how young female athletes think about female athlete role model and to discover whether they have chosen to take the path of sports because of the influence of role models, we chose three groups of athletes, who may represent different ages group and professional grades.
                </br></br>The three groups of respondents are: young people who have just entered the field of sports, college students who are in the university sports team, and female athletes who have entered the field of professional sports for many years.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="exp1">
                <p>In view of the relationship between sports brand and the shaping process of athletes' role models, we contacted and interviewed Vasileios (Bill) Davvetas, who is a Lecturer at Leeds University Business School, to discuss these issues from the perspective of sports marketing.</p>

                    <b>QUESTION:
                    </br>Instead of choosing female athlete whose image may be more aligned with sporting goods，sport brands tend to choose female celebrity for endorsement. What do you think about it?</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    ...</br>
                    So, I think this is one of the reasons, although what I tend to believe is going to happen these days, athlete become celebrity itself. If you turn time back ten years, I would expect that every day people would have athlete as role model. This is not so common as it is right now.
                    </br>So, in the past, typical role models, celebrities were people that from music industry, movie, TV series or things like that. Nowadays younger people especially aspiring to athlete. You see people wanting to go to the gym more, you see people trying to train more and having sport in their everyday lives. This is not the case in the past. So, Serena Williams right now, Nadal or LeBron James, all these people end of being stronger role models for people, especially young people than what Kim Kardashian or a TV star would be.
                    </br>So, in this sense, I think we are converging into a day when sport athlete, Olympic player are equally as good as endorsers because they become celebrity itself.

                    <b>QUESTION:
                        </br>What do you think about the influence of sports brands on female athletes' career choices?</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    ...</br>
                    However, what I think might play important role in is that these companies and the fact that they use very well-known sport personalities might influence on trying to bring more people in this sport. Not stopping people from leaving this sport but making more young people aspire to becoming a professional athlete.
                    </br>In the past, if celebrity was a movie star, younger people wanted to become movies stars. They wanted and tried to become like their role model, do what their role model do. So, if the new role model are athletes instead of movie star, then more younger girls and boys, instead of become a movie star they prefer to become an athlete.
                    </br>So, in this sense, what you can do is by building this sort of campaigns to achieve making more people entry even that you cannot stop people from leaving sport.

                <p>Girls Can, as a national organization that encourages women to enter sports, raised questions with leader of Leeds Girls Can about whether they think female athlete role models can encourage people to join sports and how society can help female athletes grow.</p>
