        <h2>APP</h2>
        <p class="text-zhuti">According to our earlier stage research, we find that there is an imbalance in the society that there is more male role model than female role model in sports area, and how important is female role model to appeal more potential female young athletes enroll in professional sports. There are many factors caused why there is a lack of female role models in the society, for instance, television coverage, sports brand, public audience and also the career obstructs faced by female athletes (ex. athletic injuries). We want to create a platform for the public to know more about female sports, which is also a channel for professional female athletes to show their expertise and life, also faces and names to the world. Furthermore, we also included a feature which used to watch more female sports matches, since the media coverage about female sports is relatively low, and we want to satisfy and attract users who are interested in female sports.
        <p class="text-zhuti">In conclusion, we create this app aiming to: </p>

                <h2>Name: Heraean</h2>
                <p class="text-zhuti">This name is originally from the name of ‘Ancient Heraean Games’ in ancient Greece. The ancient Heraean Games were a series of athletic festivals exclusively for women, held in honor of the Greek mythological goddess Hera, which took place every four years and began sometime after the start of the Olympic Games in 776 BC.</p>

                <h2>Tagline: We are #Unstoppable</h2>
                <p class="text-zhuti">We thought a lot of slogans for our app, and at last we choose this one, which is short and strong. We try to deliver that although nowadays the whole condition of female sports is not ideal, female sports will and are getting better. This sentence also designed for the female potential and young athletes and convince them ‘don’t drop out’ and ‘you are unstoppable’</p>
            </div>
            <div class="appexplain0">
                <h2>Icon: Olive leaves and branches</h2>
                <p class="text-zhuti">We choose olive leaves as our theme icon because at the end of the competitions, the victors of the Heraean Games were awarded with a wreath of olive crowns. Also, the olive branches and leaves have their spiritual symbolism of peace or victory deriving from the customs of ancient Greece. These fresh olive branches have not yet become olive crowns, indicating our hopes for the younger generation and the fact that everyone who is working on the way to the championship deserves respect, the honors are not only for the victors.</p>

                <h2>Colors Palette:</h2>
                <p class="text-zhuti">After referenced a lot of theme colors of gyms and fitness apps, we choose this mint greenish color because it can bring people a fresh feeling, since we don’t want people feel breathless and stressful when they see a dark color on a fitness app. Moreover, green is a neutral color, it’s eye-catching, bright and fun but not aggressive and suitable for various genders. (Although our main target users are female sports lovers, we also welcome other people who interested in female sports.)</p>

                <h2>Logo</h2>
                <p class="text-zhuti">There are three key characteristics of appealing logos: simplicity, recognizability and motivation (Aiello, G. and Parry, K, 2019). Our logo is simply combined with our icon, name and tagline. We try to design our icon olive leaves and branches in a feminine way since our main target users are women. All of them are in our greenish theme color palette.</p>

                <h2>Font:</h2>
                <p class="text-zhuti">Typography can enact interactions and express attitudes to what is being represented, and multimodal, integrated with other semiotic means of expression such as color, texture, three-dimensionality, and movement. (Theo van Leeuwen, 2006). We use Copperplate Gothic font in our log in page and menu page, for our name and features, since Copperplate Gothic is in capitals only, which is useful to highlight. It is also expanded, wide and less curvature, make users feel stretch, relax and peaceful. We use Futura Fonts for the main contexts in the app, which is curvier, more harmonious in different pages and more suitable for people to read.</p>

Meanwhile, to support our app operation, helping us to improve users’ experiences.</p>

                <p class="text-zhuti">This is the first page showed on the screen. We separated Heraean into ‘HER’+’AEAN’, and highlight ‘Her ’because we try to support female sports. We use a hashtag sign in our tagline as it’s more eye-catching and useful for our PR promo campaign on social media. We used olive branches as the background, to link the connotation of our icon.</p>
